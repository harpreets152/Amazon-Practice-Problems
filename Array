5->Next larger element
Given an array A [ ] having distinct elements, the task is to find the next greater element for each element of the array in order of their appearance in the array. If no such element exists, output -1 
Solution: think of stack(next greater element)

6->Maximum Index
Given an array A of integers, find the maximum of j - i subjected to the constraint of A[i] <= A[j].

Example :

A : [3 5 4 2]

Output : 2 
for the pair (3, 4)
