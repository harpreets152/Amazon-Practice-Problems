2->Find median in a stream 
Given an input stream of n integers the task is to insert integers to stream and print the median of the new stream formed by each insertion of x to the stream.

Example

Flow in stream : 5, 15, 1, 3 
5 goes to stream --> median 5 (5)
15 goes to stream --> median 10 (5, 15)
1 goes to stream --> median 5 (5, 15, 1)
3 goes to stream --> median 4 (5, 15, 1, 3)
