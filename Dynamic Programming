1->Subset Sum Problem
Given a set of numbers, check whether it can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is same or not.
Solution->create 2D array with aux[sum][n+1] and think.

2->0 - 1 Knapsack Problem
You are given weights and values of N items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. Note that we have only one quantity of each item, In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..N-1] and wt[0..N-1] which represent values and weights associated with N items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
