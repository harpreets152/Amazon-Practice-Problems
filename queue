1->First non-repeating character in a stream
Given an input stream of n characters consisting only of small case alphabets the task is to find the first non repeating character each time a character is inserted to the stream.
Example

Flow in stream : a, a, b, c
a goes to stream : 1st non repeating element a (a)
a goes to stream : no non repeating element -1 (5, 15)
b goes to stream : 1st non repeating element is b (a, a, b)
c goes to stream : 1st non repeating element is b (a, a, b, c)
