1->Search in a Rotated Array
Given a sorted and rotated array (rotated at some point) A[ ], and given an element K, the task is to find the index of the given element K in the array A[ ]. The array has no duplicate elements. If the element does not exist in the array, print -1.

2->Maximum Index
Given an array A of integers, find the maximum of j - i subjected to the constraint of A[i] <= A[j].
Example :
A : [3 5 4 2]
Output : 2 
for the pair (3, 4)


3->Majority Element
Write a program to find the majority element in the array. A majority element in an array A[] of size n is an element that appears more than n/2 times (and hence there is at most one such element).  If input array doesn't contain a majority element, then output "NO Majority Element"

5->
Given an input stream of n integers the task is to insert integers to stream and print the median of the new stream formed by each insertion of x to the stream.

Example

Flow in stream : 5, 15, 1, 3 
5 goes to stream --> median 5 (5)
15 goes to stream --> median 10 (5, 15)
1 goes to stream --> median 5 (5, 15, 1)
3 goes to stream --> median 4 (5, 15, 1, 3)
